Problems
========

1. Write a program that accepts three Strings from user : title(Mr., Ms., Mrs.) first_name and last_name and print
   : Mr./Ms/Mrs last_name first_name.<br>
   **sample input**:
   Mr.<br>
   James<br>
   Kabera<br>
   **Sample output**:<br>
   Mr. James Kabera
2. Write a program that accepts a string from user and check if the first letter and the last letter
   are equals then print "Equals" else print "Not equals".
   Try to use Conditional Operators.
3. Print the result of every question 
   1. Declare and initialize 2 lists :
      - li1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
      - li2 : 0,1,4,5,6 
   2. Add 9 to li1 and add 7,8,9 to li2 
   3. Insert 0 at the beginning of li1 and insert 2,3 after 1 in li2 
   4. Replace the last element in li1 with 10 and Replace the first 3 elements in li2 with
   11,12,13 
   5. Remove 5 and the element at index 3 from li1 and remove 3 elements with index from
   4 to 6 from li2 
   6. Print "Yes" if li2 contains 7 else print "No"
   7. Shuffle li1 and clear li2 
   8. Create new list containing the elements from 2 to 5 of li1.
4. Print the result of every question
   1. Declare and initialize 2 Sets :
      - boys : Peter,John,James,Paul,Ian,Damian
      - girls : Lenah,Emilia,Phiona,Sophie,Janet,Pamela 
   2. Add Daniel to boys and Anna & Betty to girls. 
   3. Create new set called "all" that contains both sets. 
   4. Create new set called "both" that contains the unisex names(both boys and girls). 
   5. Create new set called "onlyBoys" that contains all male-specific name (without unisex names). 
   6. remove all the unisex names from boys and remove "Lena" from girls. 
   7. Print **Yes** if "only" contains "Damian" else print **No** . 
   8. Remove all elements from "all". 
   9. Create a list called "listOfBoys" from "onlyBoys" and print its length.
5. Print the result of every question
   1. Declare and initialize this Map :
      - student :
        name : "John Kamana"
        gender : "Male"
        age : 20
        id : 12345678
        phone : 565689891
        email : "jkamana@gmail.com"
   2. Add "stateID" : "WA" and "yearEnrolled" : 2019 
   3. Check if there is a key called "phone" then delete it else print "NO"
   4. Print all keys 
   5. Check if there is a value equal to 20 then print "Yes" else print "No"
   6. Print all values 
   7. Update the "age" with 23 and "phone" with 213456789 with different methods 
   8. Print the length of this map 
   9. Clear it
6. Write a program to get a number from the user and print whether it is integer or
   double
7. Write a program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints "increasing" if the
   numbers are in increasing order, "decreasing" if the numbers are in decreasing order, and
   "Neither increasing or decreasing order" otherwise
8. Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number
   with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.
9. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then output a
   message indicating whether the number is a prime number.
10. Write a program that determine and print the number of times the character ‘a’ appears in
    the input entered by the user.
11. Write a program to calculate the factorial value of given number.
    Factorial x = x * x-1 * x-2 * … *1
12. Write a program that convert a name into initials. You can assume the program takes in
    two words with one space in between them. The output should be two capital letters with
    a dot separating them.
13. Write a program to find the first 80 numbers starting from 100 where each digit of a
    number is an even number(ex: 242). The numbers obtained should be printed in a list.
14. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
    Validation :
    - At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]. 
    - At least 1 number between [0-9]. 
    - Minimum length 6 characters. 
    - Maximum length 16 characters
15. Write a program that calculate the average of given numbers from user and ask the user
    every time for more numbers.
    If user say "yes" ask him for another number and if "No" give the average.
16. Write a program that print the number of days in month (input : 1..12).
    Note: Here we are not checking leap year, so we fixed 28 days for February.
17. Generate a random number between 1 and 10. The user have 3 tries to guess the
    number. Print "Hard Luck ---- the number is ..." if he lose and "Good Job" if he win.
18. Write a Dart function that accepts a String as a parameter and delete all vowels from it
    (A, E, I, O, and U).
19. Write a Dart function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of
    each word of the string in upper case.
    Example string : 'the best day ever' Expected Output : 'The Best Day Ever '
20. Write a Dart function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word
    within the string.
    Example string : 'we are the new generation'
    Expected Output : 'generation'
    Assume one space between words in the passed string.
21. Write a Dart function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case
    letters, lower case letters,numbers and symbols(we don't take in count the space).
22. Write a Dart function that prints the characters that occurs two times in a given string.
    Example String : 'Firebase and Flutter'
    Expected Output : 'F R A T'
23. Write a Dart recursive function to compute the factors of a positive integer.
24. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.
25. Write a program (function) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.
